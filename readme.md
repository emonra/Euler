I don't know what to put in here yet\
This is supposed to be a private repo where I intend to improve my programming skill with Project Euler on Python\
Each solution is designed to work as a standalone, with the exception of libraries, so there shouldn't be imports from other problems\
Project Euler problems: https://projecteuler.net/archives
